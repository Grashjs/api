# Grash CMMS API

This project aims to help manage assets, schedule maintenance and track work orders. This is the REST backend of the web
application developed with React. The frontend developed with React can be
found [here](https://github.com/Grashjs/frontend). We are in the beta phase and are planning to create a React Native
mobile application. The link to the live website can be found [here](https://grash-cmms.com).  
You can see more explanations in [Purpose.pdf](Purpose.pdf). We would be very happy to have new contributors join us.
